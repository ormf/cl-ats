A T S

ATS is a library of Lisp functions for spectral Analysis, 
Transformation, and Synthesis of sound based on a sinusoidal plus
critical-band noise model. A sound in ATS is a symbolic object 
representing a spectral model that can be sculpted using a variety of
transformation functions. Spectral data can be accessed through an API, 
and saved to/loaded from disk.  ATS analysis and synthesis algorithms 
are implemented using the CLM (Common Lisp Music) synthesis and sound 
processing language.

This document explains how to install ATS, documentation can be found at

Installing ATS (on Linux):
you must have CLM-2 running in order to install ATS. You can get CLM at:

http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/

NOTE: you must get the latest CLM-2 distribution, otherwise the save/load
functions of ATS will not work. Those functions use code that comes in the CLM 
distribution file clm1.cl, be sure this file gets compiled and loaded when
you build CLM.

Once you have a CLM Lisp image built up, unpack the ATS tarball 
in your system doing:

tar xvzf  ATS-1.0.tar.gz

this will create a directory called ATS-1.0 inside the directory
were the package was extracted. If this was not done in your home 
directory you should edit the file all.cl to reflect ATS' path, you
can do this by changing the first line of code:
 
(defparameter *ats-dir* "~/ATS-1.0/")

save changes to the file, then fire up CLM and load all.cl: 

(load "all.cl")

this should compile and load all ATS' Lisp files and CLM instruments.

Running ATS:

To run ATS you can build a new Lisp image with both CLM and ATS in it, 
or just load all.cl from a running CLM image, compiled files will be 
automatically loaded.

Now you are ready to go, see examples.cl for analysis and synthesis
examples. Enjoy!.
